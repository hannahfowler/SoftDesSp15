---Machine Learning Toolbox Questions---

1. The general trend in the curve is somewhat upward, but noisy in between. 
2. The beginning parts of the curve appear to be noisier. This is due to the initial training of the model. 
3. It isn't until you run each percentage around 200 times that you begin to see a smooth curve. 
4. Making C a very large positive number makes the general curve much smoother and gives a nice curve. 		   However, making C a negative number with a large magnitude makes the general curve downward.
